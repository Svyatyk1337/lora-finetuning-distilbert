# LoRA Fine-Tuning for DistilBERT

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a DistilBERT model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for text classification tasks. The focus is to efficiently fine-tune the model for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to fine-tune a DistilBERT model for classifying the sentiment of movie reviews using LoRA. LoRA allows for more efficient fine-tuning with fewer parameters, making the process faster and less resource-intensive.
